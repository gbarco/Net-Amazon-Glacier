Net-Amazon-Glacier

This module implements the full Amazon Glacier API 2012-06-01, current as of
2014. It can be used to manage Glacier vaults and upload archives to them.
Amazon states "Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service
that provides secure and durable storage for data archiving and backup. In order
to keep costs low, Amazon Glacier is optimized for data that is infrequently
accessed and for which retrieval times of several hours are suitable. With
Amazon Glacier, customers can reliably store large or small amounts of data for
as little as $0.01 per gigabyte per month, a significant savings compared to
on-premises solutions."
